# Admin Dashboard - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

A simple admin dashboard at `/admin` that allows you to control which blog posts are visible without modifying Sanity content or requiring write permissions.

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. **Data Flow**
```
Sanity CMS (read-only)
      ‚Üì
Admin Dashboard (/admin)
      ‚Üì
TypeScript File (data/selected-posts.ts)
      ‚Üì
Blog Pages (filtered by selected IDs)
```

### 2. **Admin Dashboard**
- **Location**: `http://localhost:3000/admin`
- **Function**: Displays all posts from Sanity with toggle switches
- **Action**: Clicking a toggle adds/removes the post ID from `selected-posts.ts`

### 3. **Blog Pages**
All blog pages import and use `selectedPostIds` from the TypeScript file:
- Homepage: Shows latest 6 selected posts
- Blog page: Shows all selected posts with pagination
- Category pages: Shows selected posts in that category
- Individual posts: All posts remain accessible by direct URL

## üìÅ File Structure

### New Files
```
data/
  selected-posts.ts            # Stores selected post IDs (TypeScript)

middleware.ts                  # Protects admin routes

app/
  admin/
    page.tsx                   # Admin dashboard UI (with logout)
    login/
      page.tsx                 # Admin login page
  api/
    admin/
      auth/
        route.ts               # Authentication endpoint
      toggle-featured/
        route.ts               # API to toggle selections
      selected-posts/
        route.ts               # API to read selections
```

### Modified Files
```
sanity/lib/queries.ts          # Simplified queries (removed Sanity filtering)
app/(blog)/page.tsx            # Added local ID filtering
app/(blog)/blog/page.tsx       # Added local ID filtering  
app/(blog)/category/[slug]/page.tsx  # Added local ID filtering
sanity/schemas/post.ts         # Removed featured field (not needed)
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Development
1. Start server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/admin`
3. Toggle posts on/off
4. View blog to see only selected posts

### Production
1. Select posts in dev environment
2. Commit `data/selected-posts.json` to git
3. Deploy as normal
4. To change selections: update locally, commit, redeploy

## üîë Key Benefits

‚úÖ **No Sanity Write Token Required** - Only needs read access
‚úÖ **No Sanity Schema Changes** - Doesn't modify your CMS structure  
‚úÖ **Type-Safe** - TypeScript file for better IDE support and type checking
‚úÖ **Simple & Fast** - Local TypeScript file for instant updates
‚úÖ **Version Controlled** - Post selections tracked in git
‚úÖ **Direct Import** - Blog pages directly import selections (no runtime parsing)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security
- The `/admin` route is **password protected**
- Password set via `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable
- Authentication uses HTTP-only cookies (7-day expiration)
- Login page at `/admin/login`
- Logout button available in dashboard

### Limitations
- In production, selections must be updated via code push
- For dynamic production updates, consider adding authentication + database

## üìä Example Usage

### Initial State (No Selections)
```typescript
export const selectedPostIds: string[] = []
```
Result: Blog appears empty

### After Selecting Posts
```typescript
// Selected post IDs - posts that will be visible on the blog
export const selectedPostIds: string[] = [
  "post-abc123",
  "post-def456", 
  "post-ghi789",
]
```
Result: Only these 3 posts appear on blog

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Posts not showing?
‚Üí Check they're toggled ON in admin dashboard

### Admin dashboard empty?
‚Üí Verify posts exist in Sanity Studio

### Toggle not working?
‚Üí Check browser console and terminal for errors
‚Üí Verify `data` directory permissions

## Summary

You now have a fully functional admin dashboard that:
- Fetches all posts from Sanity (read-only)
- Stores selections in a type-safe TypeScript file
- Filters blog pages by selected posts
- Requires no Sanity API tokens
- Works in both development and production
- Provides IDE autocomplete and type checking

The implementation is simple, maintainable, type-safe, and doesn't require complex authentication or database setup for basic usage.
