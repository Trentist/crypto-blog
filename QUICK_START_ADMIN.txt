üöÄ QUICK START: Admin Dashboard Setup
==========================================

‚úÖ What's Been Done:

- Selections stored locally in data/selected-posts.ts (TypeScript)

üìù What You Need To Do:

1. SET ADMIN PASSWORD:
   Add to .env.local:
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password

2. START SERVER:
   npm run dev

3. LOGIN TO ADMIN:
   - Visit: http://localhost:3000/admin
   - Enter your password
   - Click Login

4. SELECT POSTS TO DISPLAY:
   - Toggle posts ON (green) to show on blog
   - Toggle posts OFF (gray) to hide from blog
   - Changes save automatically
   - Click Logout when done

5. VIEW YOUR BLOG:
   - Homepage: http://localhost:3000
   - Blog page: http://localhost:3000/blog
   - Only selected posts will appear

6. FOR PRODUCTION:
   - Set ADMIN_PASSWORD in Vercel/hosting env vars
   - Commit data/selected-posts.ts to git

üéâ That's it! Admin dashboard is password protected!
